# MisCar Web Application
The project is (funny enough) not affiliated with MisCar currently.

## Setting Up
In order to configure this application for your own team, you need to follow the following steps:

- Create a new firebase project.
- Clone the application's scripts (and run `npm install`).
- Deploy the scripts using `firebase deploy`.
- In the `constants.tsx` file inside the source folder, change the configuration to match your firebase project. You can get the API URL from the Functions tab.

## Dependencies
- This is only the frontend of the application. The firebase scripts are inside another repository.
- You will need NodeJS and React to develop this app. If you have node installed, just run npm install inside the root directory of the project.
