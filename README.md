# MisCar Web Application
The project is (funny enough) not affiliated with MisCar currently.

## Dependencies
- This is only the frontend of the application. The firebase scripts are inside another repository.
- You will need NodeJS and React to develop this app. If you have node installed, just run npm install inside the root directory of the project.
